"""Episodic memory strategy — meaningful interaction sequences.

What you learn:
    - Configure `episodicMemoryStrategy` on CreateMemory
    - Drive a multi-turn interaction (incl. a TOOL turn) that has a beginning/middle/end
    - Retrieve episodes + reflections via RetrieveMemoryRecords (hierarchical namespace)

Episodic strategy captures "episodes" — meaningful sequences of turns
that hang together as one event in the user's life ("debugged a memory
leak in service X on Tuesday"). It also adds a *reflection* step that
generates cross-episode insights.

Episode-completion signal: extraction only fires once the service detects the
episode has CONCLUDED. Completion uses next-turn lookahead, so each episode below
ends with an explicit closing turn AND a trailing turn confirming it — a final
turn with nothing after it reads as "still in progress" and never extracts.

Two ways to run it:
    python episodic.py boto3    # the raw AWS API, no SDK. Shows exactly what's on the wire.
    python episodic.py sdk      # the AgentCore SDK (MemorySessionManager). The recommended way.

The `sdk` path needs bedrock-agentcore 1.14 or newer, because it retrieves with
`search_long_term_memories(namespace_path=...)`. Older versions only accept the
deprecated `namespace_prefix=`.

Add `--cleanup` to delete the memory resource at the end. By default the
memory is kept so you can inspect it; the script prints the memoryId.

SDK note: `MemoryClient.add_episodic_strategy()` exists, but here we pass the
raw `episodicMemoryStrategy` shape to `create_memory_and_wait` so the boto3 and
sdk paths stay 1:1. The episodic strategy REQUIRES a `reflectionConfiguration`
whose namespace is the same as (or a prefix of) the episode namespace —
omitting it makes CreateMemory fail.

Namespaces: episodes are written per session (more nested) and reflections roll
up per actor (the prefix). We retrieve across that hierarchy with `namespacePath`
(`namespace_path=` in the SDK), which returns records under the same parent —
both the session-scoped episodes and the actor-scoped reflections.
