# # LangGraph with AgentCore Memory (Multi-Agent — Shared Memory)
#
# ## Introduction
#
# This tutorial demonstrates a **multi-agent system** built with **LangGraph**
# (`create_agent`) where several specialized agents collaborate through a **single shared
# AgentCore Memory resource**. The single-agent tutorials
# (`../../single-agent/with-langgraph-agent/`) wired memory into one agent. Here the same
# memory primitive becomes the **communication substrate** for a team: one agent writes,
# the next reads what it wrote, and so on down a pipeline.
#
# The use case is a **research team**:
#   1. **Research Agent** gathers raw findings on a topic and writes them to memory.
#   2. **Analyst Agent** retrieves the researcher's findings, synthesizes them into
#      insights, and writes the synthesis back to memory.
#   3. **Report Agent** retrieves BOTH the findings and the synthesis, then writes a final
#      executive summary.
#
# Each agent is a **separate LangGraph `create_agent`** with its own system prompt and its
# own **`actor_id`**. What ties them together is that they all read/write the **same
# `memory_id`** — a memory resource is just a resource ID, and any number of clients can
# use it concurrently. That is the whole multi-agent pattern: shared `memory_id`, per-agent
# `actor_id`, and a deliberate namespace design that decides what is *shared* across the
# team versus *private* to one agent.
#
# > **LangGraph API note (v1.0):** Each agent is built with the current
# > **`from langchain.agents import create_agent`** API (the older
# > `langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent` is deprecated in v1.0). The agents themselves
# > have no tools — they reason over text — so the multi-agent mechanics live entirely in
# > how we route their I/O through the shared `MemoryClient` (`create_event` /
# > `retrieve_memories`), keeping the shared-memory pattern explicit and framework-neutral.

# You'll learn to:
# - Share ONE AgentCore Memory resource across multiple independent LangGraph agents
# - Give each agent its own `actor_id` while all agents target the same `memory_id`
# - Design namespaces so some knowledge is **team-shared** and some is **agent-private**
# - Hand off work between agents: Agent B retrieves what Agent A stored (producer/consumer)
# - Orchestrate a sequential pipeline where each agent builds on the previous one's output
#
# ## How memory is shared (the core idea)
#
# A memory resource is identified by a plain `memory_id`. Nothing binds it to a single
# agent. Three identifiers decide who-can-see-what:
#
# | Identifier    | Role in a multi-agent system                                                    |
# |---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
# | `memory_id`   | The shared resource. SAME for every agent — this is what makes memory shared.   |
# | `actor_id`    | WHO is writing/reading. Each agent has a distinct one, PLUS a team identity.    |
# | `namespace`   | WHERE records land. `{actorId}` is substituted from the event's `actor_id`.     |
#
# The namespace template `"/research-team/{actorId}/knowledge/"` has its `{actorId}`
# placeholder filled from the `actor_id` passed to `create_event`. So the SAME template
# produces a SHARED pool or a PRIVATE slice depending only on which actor_id you write under:
#
#   • Write with actor_id="team-shared"     → "/research-team/team-shared/knowledge/"
#       → the TEAM BLACKBOARD every agent reads from and writes to.
#   • Write with actor_id="research-agent"  → "/research-team/research-agent/knowledge/"
#       → that agent's PRIVATE scratchpad, isolated from the others.
#
# Agent B "sees" Agent A's work because B retrieves from the shared blackboard that A wrote
# to — not because they share a conversation (they don't). This is the producer/consumer
# pattern, with AgentCore Memory as the channel.
#

# ## Prerequisites
#
# - Python 3.10+
# - AWS credentials with AgentCore Memory permissions AND Amazon Bedrock model access
# - Access to the Claude Sonnet 4.6 model in Amazon Bedrock (request it in the Bedrock
#   console under *Model access*, in your chosen region)
# - No IAM execution role required — we use a **built-in** Semantic strategy.
#
# Let's get started by setting up our environment!

MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6"

# ---- Actor identities ------------------------------------------------------------
# Every agent shares the SAME memory_id (created in Step 3). They differ by actor_id. Each
# agent has its own actor_id for PRIVATE scratch space, plus one "team" actor_id whose
# namespace is the SHARED blackboard all agents read/write.
RESEARCH_ACTOR_ID = "research-agent"
ANALYST_ACTOR_ID = "analyst-agent"
REPORT_ACTOR_ID = "report-agent"
SHARED_ACTOR_ID = "team-shared"  # records written under this actor form the team blackboard

# One session ties this pipeline run together. All three agents use the same session_id so
# the run reads as one coherent collaboration in the event history.
SESSION_ID = f"research-run-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}"

# Namespace template. `{actorId}` is substituted at extraction time from the actor_id on
# the event. The SAME template yields the shared blackboard or a private slice depending
# only on which actor_id we write under. Always end namespace templates with "/".

#
# This is the resource ALL agents share. We attach a single built-in **Semantic** strategy
# whose namespace template is `/research-team/{actorId}/knowledge/`. Because `{actorId}` is
# substituted from the event's actor_id, this ONE strategy serves both the shared team
# blackboard (actor_id="team-shared") and each agent's private slice — no separate strategy
