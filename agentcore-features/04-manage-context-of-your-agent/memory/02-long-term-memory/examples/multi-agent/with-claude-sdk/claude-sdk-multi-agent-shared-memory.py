# # Claude SDK with AgentCore Memory (Multi-Agent — Shared Memory)
#
#
# ## Introduction
#
# This tutorial demonstrates a **multi-agent system** built directly on the
# **Anthropic Claude SDK** (via Amazon Bedrock) where several specialized agents
# collaborate through a **single shared AgentCore Memory resource**. The single-agent
# tutorials (`../../single-agent/with-claude-sdk/`) wired memory into one agent. Here
# the same memory primitive becomes the **communication substrate** for a team: one
# agent writes, the next reads what it wrote, and so on down a pipeline.
#
# The use case is a **research team**:
#   1. **Research Agent** gathers raw findings on a topic and writes them to memory.
#   2. **Analyst Agent** retrieves the researcher's findings, synthesizes them into
#      insights, and writes the synthesis back to memory.
#   3. **Report Agent** retrieves BOTH the findings and the synthesis, then writes a
#      final executive summary.
#
# Each agent is a **separate Claude conversation** (its own `messages[]` array) and has
# its own **`actor_id`**. What ties them together is that they all use the **same
# `memory_id`** — a memory resource is just a resource ID, and any number of clients can
# read and write it concurrently. That is the whole multi-agent pattern: shared
# `memory_id`, per-agent `actor_id`, and a deliberate namespace design that decides what
# is *shared* across the team versus *private* to one agent.
#
# **NOTE:** We use a built-in **Semantic** strategy, so each agent's `create_event`
# call feeds the same asynchronous extraction pipeline, and the next agent's
# `retrieve_memories` reads the distilled records back. Built-in strategies require NO
# IAM execution role. Extraction is asynchronous (~30-90s), so after each agent writes
# we wait for its records to surface before the next agent retrieves them — exactly the
# producer/consumer handoff a real sequential pipeline needs.

# You'll learn to:
# - Share ONE AgentCore Memory resource across multiple independent Claude agents
# - Give each agent its own `actor_id` while all agents target the same `memory_id`
# - Design namespaces so some knowledge is **team-shared** and some is **agent-private**
# - Hand off work between agents: Agent B retrieves what Agent A stored (producer/consumer)
# - Orchestrate a sequential pipeline where each agent builds on the previous one's output
# - Keep each agent as a separate Claude conversation (separate `messages[]` arrays)
#
# ## How memory is shared (the core idea)
#
# A memory resource is identified by a plain `memory_id`. Nothing binds it to a single
# agent — every agent in this script constructs its own `MemoryClient` against the SAME
# `memory_id`. Three identifiers decide who-can-see-what:
#
# | Identifier    | Role in a multi-agent system                                                    |
# |---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
# | `memory_id`   | The shared resource. SAME for every agent — this is what makes memory shared.   |
# | `actor_id`    | WHO is writing/reading. We give each agent a distinct one, PLUS a team identity. |
# | `namespace`   | WHERE records land. `{actorId}` is substituted from the event's `actor_id`.     |
#
# The namespace template `"/research-team/{actorId}/knowledge/"` has its `{actorId}`
# placeholder filled in **from the `actor_id` passed to `create_event`** (verified
# against this repo's `02-long-term-memory/04-namespaces/` tutorial). So the SAME
# template produces a SHARED pool or a PRIVATE slice depending only on which actor_id
# you write under:
#
#   • Write with actor_id="team-shared"     → "/research-team/team-shared/knowledge/"
#       → the TEAM BLACKBOARD every agent reads from and writes to.
#   • Write with actor_id="research-agent"  → "/research-team/research-agent/knowledge/"
#       → that agent's PRIVATE scratchpad, isolated from the others.
#
# Agent B "sees" Agent A's work because B retrieves from the shared blackboard that A
# wrote to — not because they share a conversation (they don't). This is the producer/
# consumer pattern, with AgentCore Memory as the channel.

#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# To execute this tutorial you will need:
# - Python 3.10+
# - AWS credentials with AgentCore Memory permissions AND Amazon Bedrock model access
# - Access to the Claude Sonnet 4.6 model in Amazon Bedrock (request it in the
#   Bedrock console under Model access, in your chosen region)
#
# Let's get started by setting up our environment!

# ## Step 1: Setup and Imports


# Run: pip install -qr requirements.txt


import logging
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime

# The Anthropic SDK's Amazon Bedrock client. `pip install "anthropic[bedrock]"`
# provides this; it signs requests with your AWS credentials (SigV4) and speaks the
# Messages API against Bedrock — no Anthropic API key required.
from anthropic import AnthropicBedrock

# AgentCore Memory client and the StrategyType enum (gives us the exact strategy keys).
from bedrock_agentcore.memory import MemoryClient
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.constants import StrategyType

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
logger = logging.getLogger("claude-sdk-multi-agent")

# Configuration
REGION = os.getenv("AWS_REGION", "us-west-2")  # AWS region for both Bedrock and Memory

# Model ID for Claude Sonnet 4.6 on Amazon Bedrock.
# The `global.` prefix selects the global (cross-region) inference endpoint, which is
# the default for Sonnet 4.6 and carries no regional pricing premium. To pin traffic
# to a region instead, swap the prefix (e.g. "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6").
MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6"

# ---- Actor identities ------------------------------------------------------------
# Every agent shares the SAME memory_id (created in Step 5). They differ by actor_id.
# We give each agent its own actor_id for PRIVATE scratch space, and define one extra
# "team" actor_id whose namespace is the SHARED blackboard all agents read/write.
RESEARCH_ACTOR_ID = "research-agent"
ANALYST_ACTOR_ID = "analyst-agent"
REPORT_ACTOR_ID = "report-agent"
SHARED_ACTOR_ID = "team-shared"  # records written under this actor form the team blackboard

# One session ties this pipeline run together. All three agents use the same session_id
# so the run reads as one coherent collaboration in the event history.
SESSION_ID = f"research-run-{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}"

# Namespace template. `{actorId}` is substituted at extraction time from the actor_id
# on the event (see this repo's 04-namespaces tutorial). The SAME template yields the
# shared blackboard or a private slice depending only on which actor_id we write under.
# Always end namespace templates with "/" so prefix matching can't collide siblings.
NAMESPACE_TEMPLATE = "/research-team/{actorId}/knowledge/"

# The shared blackboard namespace, fully resolved. This is the channel between agents.
SHARED_NAMESPACE = NAMESPACE_TEMPLATE.format(actorId=SHARED_ACTOR_ID)

# Long-term extraction is asynchronous — records appear ~30-90s after create_event.
# Because this is a SEQUENTIAL handoff (each agent consumes the previous agent's
# output), we must wait for extraction between stages. We poll but cap the wait.
EXTRACTION_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS = 120
EXTRACTION_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 15

# The research topic the whole team works on.
RESEARCH_TOPIC = (
    "The operational trade-offs of adopting vector databases for "
    "retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in production systems."
)

# Per-agent system prompts. Each agent is a distinct persona with a distinct job in the
# pipeline. They never share a conversation — only the memory resource.
RESEARCH_AGENT_PROMPT = (
    "You are a Research Agent on a research team. Your job is to gather concrete, "
    "factual findings on the assigned topic: specific capabilities, constraints, costs, "
    "and trade-offs. Produce a tight set of discrete findings (bullet points), each a "
    "self-contained, verifiable statement. Do not editorialize or conclude — just "
    "surface the raw findings for your teammates to build on. "
    f"Today's date: {datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}."
)

ANALYST_AGENT_PROMPT = (
    "You are an Analyst Agent on a research team. Your teammate the Research Agent has "
    "gathered raw findings, which are provided to you from shared memory. Your job is to "
    "SYNTHESIZE them: identify themes, tensions, and the decision factors that matter "
    "most. Produce a short synthesis (3-5 insights), each grounded in the findings you "
    "were given. Do not invent facts beyond the provided findings. "
    f"Today's date: {datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}."
)

REPORT_AGENT_PROMPT = (
    "You are a Report Agent on a research team. Both the raw findings (from the Research "
    "Agent) and the synthesis (from the Analyst Agent) are provided to you from shared "
    "memory. Your job is to write a crisp EXECUTIVE SUMMARY for a busy decision-maker: "
    "a one-paragraph overview followed by a short, prioritized recommendation list. "
    "Ground every claim in the provided material. "
    f"Today's date: {datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}."
)


# ## Step 2: Initialize the Claude (Bedrock) and Memory clients
#
# The `AnthropicBedrock` client resolves AWS credentials the same way boto3 does
# (environment variables, shared `~/.aws/credentials`, or an instance/role profile).
# We only need to tell it which region to call. A single Claude client and a single
# MemoryClient are reused by all three agents — what differs per agent is the actor_id,
# system prompt, and `messages[]` array, not the underlying clients.

memory_client = MemoryClient(region_name=REGION)
logger.info(f"✅ Clients initialized for region: {REGION}")


# ## Step 3: Create the shared memory resource (one built-in Semantic strategy)
#
# This is the resource ALL agents share. We attach a single built-in **Semantic**
# strategy whose namespace template is `/research-team/{actorId}/knowledge/`. Because
# `{actorId}` is substituted from the event's actor_id, this ONE strategy serves both the
# shared team blackboard (actor_id="team-shared") and each agent's private slice
# (actor_id=<agent>) — no separate strategy per agent required.
#
# Built-in strategies require NO IAM execution role — AgentCore manages the extraction
# and consolidation models. `create_or_get_memory` blocks until the resource is ACTIVE.
# If a memory with this name already exists, it returns that one instead of failing.

    # template covers every actor_id the team writes under (shared + per-agent).

                "namespaces": [NAMESPACE_TEMPLATE],
            }
        }
    ]

    # create_or_get_memory creates the resource and blocks until it is ACTIVE. If a
    # memory with this name already exists, it returns the existing one instead of
    # failing — so a re-run reuses the same resource without us hand-rolling the lookup.

    return memory_id


# ## Step 4: Memory read/write helpers (the shared channel)
#
# These two helpers are how agents talk to each other. `store_to_memory` writes an
# agent's output under a given actor_id (which selects shared vs private), and
# `retrieve_from_memory` reads back from a resolved namespace. They are deliberately
# thin wrappers over `create_event` / `retrieve_memories` so the multi-agent mechanics
