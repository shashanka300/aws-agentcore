# # Claude SDK with AgentCore Memory (Long-Term Memory — Episodic Strategy)
#
#
# ## Introduction
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to build a **debugging assistant** using the
# **Anthropic Claude SDK** (via Amazon Bedrock) with AgentCore **long-term memory**
# powered by the **built-in Episodic strategy**. Where the Semantic strategy distills
# isolated *facts* about the user (see `01-built-in-strategies`), the Episodic strategy
# captures whole *episodes* — meaningful, multi-turn interaction sequences that hang
# together as one event ("debugged a memory leak in the payment service on Tuesday").
#
# That difference is the whole point of this tutorial:
#   - **Semantic** answers "what facts do I know about this user?"
#     → "The user runs a Python payment service."
#   - **Episodic** answers "what happened last time, and how did it go?"
#     → "Last Tuesday we chased a memory leak; the root cause was an unbounded cache
#        with no TTL; fixed in v2.4.1." plus cross-episode **reflections** that surface
#        patterns ("unbounded caches are a recurring leak source for this team").
#
# Because the Anthropic SDK is a **stateless API client** with NO built-in conversation
# management or hooks, the integration is fully explicit. We:
#   1. create a memory resource with the EPISODIC strategy,
#   2. run MULTIPLE distinct debugging sessions with Claude — each session is one
#      **episode**, persisted turn-by-turn with `create_event`,
#   3. wait for the asynchronous Extraction → Consolidation → Reflection pipeline,
#   4. retrieve past episodes with `retrieve_memories`, and
#   5. inject them into the system prompt of a *new* debugging session so the agent
#      recalls "what happened last time" — not just static facts.
#
# **NOTE:** Built-in strategies (Episodic included) do NOT require an IAM execution role.
# AgentCore Memory manages the extraction/consolidation/reflection models for you. To
# customize those models or prompts, see the strategy-override examples under
# `02-long-term-memory` (the Episodic override key is `episodicMemoryStrategy` inside a
# `customMemoryStrategy`, with `episodicExtractionOverride` / `episodicConsolidationOverride`
# / `episodicReflectionOverride` configuration blocks).
#
#
# ### A note on "episodic" examples elsewhere in this repo
#
# Some sibling examples are *named* "episodic" but actually configure a **Semantic**
# strategy (`semanticMemoryStrategy`) or a `customMemoryStrategy` with a semantic
# override — not the dedicated Episodic strategy. This tutorial deliberately uses the
# REAL built-in Episodic strategy, whose wire key is `episodicMemoryStrategy`
# (verified against the SDK: `bedrock_agentcore.memory.constants.StrategyType.EPISODIC`).
# See the README's "Verifying the strategy" section for how to confirm this at runtime.

# You'll learn to:
# - Create a memory resource with the built-in **Episodic** strategy (no IAM role required)
# - Call Claude through Amazon Bedrock using the `AnthropicBedrock` client
# - Run MULTIPLE sessions, each a distinct episode, storing turns with `create_event`
# - Wait for the asynchronous Extraction → Consolidation → Reflection pipeline
# - Retrieve past episodes (and cross-episode reflections) with `retrieve_memories`
# - Inject episodic recall into a new session so the agent knows "what happened last time"

#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# To execute this tutorial you will need:
# - Python 3.10+
# - AWS credentials with AgentCore Memory permissions AND Amazon Bedrock model access
# - Access to the Claude Sonnet 4.6 model in Amazon Bedrock (request it in the
#   Bedrock console under Model access, in your chosen region)
#
# Let's get started by setting up our environment!

# ## Step 1: Setup and Imports


# Run: pip install -qr requirements.txt


import logging
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional

# The Anthropic SDK's Amazon Bedrock client. `pip install "anthropic[bedrock]"`
# provides this; it signs requests with your AWS credentials (SigV4) and speaks the
# Messages API against Bedrock — no Anthropic API key required.
from anthropic import AnthropicBedrock

# AgentCore Memory client and the StrategyType enum (gives us the exact strategy keys).
from bedrock_agentcore.memory import MemoryClient
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.constants import StrategyType

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
logger = logging.getLogger("claude-sdk-ltm-episodic")

# Configuration
REGION = os.getenv("AWS_REGION", "us-west-2")  # AWS region for both Bedrock and Memory
ACTOR_ID = "developer_001"  # Any unique identifier for the end-user / agent

# Model ID for Claude Sonnet 4.6 on Amazon Bedrock.
# The `global.` prefix selects the global (cross-region) inference endpoint, which is
# the default for Sonnet 4.6 and carries no regional pricing premium. To pin traffic
# to a region instead, swap the prefix (e.g. "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6").
MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6"

# The Episodic strategy writes EPISODE records to this namespace. We use an ACTOR-level
# template (no {sessionId}) so a single retrieval surfaces episodes from ALL of the
# developer's past sessions — exactly what "what happened in previous debugging sessions?"
# needs. `{actorId}` is substituted at extraction time, keeping each developer's episodes
# isolated. The SDK default for EPISODIC is session-scoped
# (/strategies/{memoryStrategyId}/actors/{actorId}/sessions/{sessionId}/); we override it
# here precisely so episodes accumulate per-actor and remain retrievable across sessions.
# NOTE: we pass this under `namespaceTemplates` (the current field). The older `namespaces`
# field was deprecated 2026-03-02 in favor of `namespaceTemplates`; the service stores the
# same value either way, so the resolved retrieval namespace below is unchanged.
EPISODIC_NAMESPACE = "/episodes/{actorId}/"

# Cross-episode REFLECTIONS (insights folded across episodes, e.g. "unbounded caches are a
# recurring leak source for this team") need their own namespace, and the service REQUIRES
# `reflectionConfiguration` for the episodic strategy — omitting it is the root cause of
# the CreateMemory ValidationException this tutorial previously hit.
#
# The service also enforces a SECOND rule the API model doesn't declare: the reflection
# namespace "must be the same as or a prefix of the episodic namespace." A disjoint path
# (e.g. "/reflections/{actorId}/") is rejected. We set the reflection namespace EQUAL to
# the episode namespace, which satisfies the "same as" rule and keeps this tutorial's
# single-namespace design intact: both episodes and reflections land in
# "/episodes/{actorId}/", so one `retrieve_memories` call surfaces both — exactly the
# "episodes (and cross-episode reflections)" behavior the retrieval code documents.
# (The repo's working episodic example instead NESTS them — reflection
# "/meetings/actor/{actorId}/" as a prefix of episode "/meetings/actor/{actorId}/episodes/";
# either shape is valid. Equal is the smaller change here.)
REFLECTION_NAMESPACE = EPISODIC_NAMESPACE

# Episodic extraction is asynchronous and runs THREE steps (Extraction → Consolidation →
# Reflection), so it takes far longer to surface than a single-step semantic extraction.
# Episodes typically appear ~1 min after a session's events are written, but Reflection
# can take 10–15 minutes (per AWS guidance and the repo's working episodic examples). We
# poll but cap the total wait at 15 minutes so the demo reliably surfaces episode records.
EXTRACTION_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS = 1200  # 20 minutes — episodes observed surfacing ~16 min after seeding
EXTRACTION_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 15

# Base persona for the assistant. When we resume, we APPEND retrieved episodes to this.
SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are an expert debugging assistant. You help developers diagnose and fix software "
    "defects methodically: clarify symptoms, form hypotheses, isolate the root cause, and "
    "confirm the fix. Be concise and concrete. "
    f"Today's date: {datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}."
)


# ## Step 2: Initialize the Claude (Bedrock) and Memory clients
#
# The `AnthropicBedrock` client resolves AWS credentials the same way boto3 does
# (environment variables, shared `~/.aws/credentials`, or an instance/role profile).
# We only need to tell it which region to call.


claude = AnthropicBedrock(aws_region=REGION)
memory_client = MemoryClient(region_name=REGION)
logger.info(f"✅ Clients initialized for region: {REGION}")


# ## Step 3: Create the Memory Resource (with the built-in EPISODIC strategy)
#
# This is the key difference from the semantic tutorial. There we attached Semantic +
# User Preference strategies, which extract standalone facts. Here we attach the
# **Episodic** strategy, which captures whole interaction sequences as episodes and runs
# an extra **Reflection** step to derive cross-episode insights.
#
# The strategy is a single-key dict whose key is the wire value of
# `StrategyType.EPISODIC` — i.e. the literal string `"episodicMemoryStrategy"`. We use
# the enum (`StrategyType.EPISODIC.value`) rather than hardcoding the string so the code
# stays correct if the SDK ever changes the wire name.
#
# Built-in strategies require NO IAM execution role — AgentCore manages the extraction,
# consolidation, AND reflection models. `create_or_get_memory` blocks until the resource
# is ACTIVE, and on a name clash it returns the existing memory instead of erroring — so
# re-running the tutorial reuses the same memory by name.


def get_or_create_memory(name: str) -> str:
    """Create a memory with the built-in Episodic strategy, or reuse it if it exists."""
    # StrategyType.EPISODIC.value == "episodicMemoryStrategy" (verified in the SDK:
    # bedrock_agentcore/memory/constants.py). This is the REAL episodic strategy — not a
    # semantic strategy renamed "episodic", which is a mistake some examples make.

                    "recurring root causes and effective strategies."
                ),
                # Episode records land here (current field is `namespaceTemplates`; the

        }
    ]

    # create_or_get_memory creates the resource and waits until it's ACTIVE, or — if a
    # memory with this name already exists — returns that existing memory dict instead of
    # raising. Either way we get back a dict carrying the resource "id".
    memory = memory_client.create_or_get_memory(

    return memory_id


# ## Step 3b: Verify the configured strategy is actually EPISODIC
#
# The whole premise of this tutorial is "use the REAL episodic strategy." So we verify it
# at runtime instead of trusting the request we sent. `get_memory_strategies` returns the
# strategies as the service stored them; we assert at least one reports an episodic type.
# (The control plane reports the strategy `type` as the enum-style value `EPISODIC`.)

# ## Step 4: Run a debugging session (one episode)
#
# Each *session* is one episode. Within a session we run several turns — mirroring the
# back-and-forth of a real debugging session (symptom → hypothesis → isolation → fix) —
# keeping the `messages[]` array by hand, exactly like the semantic tutorial. The
# difference is purely in how AgentCore processes the stored events: the Episodic strategy
# groups the turns of a session into a coherent episode.
#
# We accumulate the (text, role) tuples for the whole session and write them with a SINGLE
# `create_event` per session. `create_event` accepts the full ordered list of turns, and
# grouping a session's turns in one event gives the episodic pipeline a clean,
# self-contained sequence to consolidate into one episode.
