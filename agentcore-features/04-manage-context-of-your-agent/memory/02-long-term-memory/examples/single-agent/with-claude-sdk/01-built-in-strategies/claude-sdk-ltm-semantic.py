# # Claude SDK with AgentCore Memory (Long-Term Memory — Built-in Strategies)
#
#
# ## Introduction
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to build a **conversational agent** using the
# **Anthropic Claude SDK** (via Amazon Bedrock) with AgentCore **long-term memory**
# powered by **built-in strategies**. Where short-term memory stores raw conversation
# turns verbatim (see the 01-short-term-memory examples), long-term memory runs an
# asynchronous extraction pipeline over those turns and distills them into reusable,
# searchable records — standalone facts and stable user preferences.
#
# Because the Anthropic SDK is a **stateless API client** with NO built-in conversation
# management or hooks, the integration is fully explicit. We:
#   1. create a memory resource WITH strategies (SEMANTIC + USER_PREFERENCE),
#   2. drive a conversation, persisting each turn with `create_event` (the same call
#      used for short-term memory — adding strategies is what triggers extraction),
#   3. wait for the asynchronous extraction to run,
#   4. retrieve the distilled records with `retrieve_memories`, and
#   5. inject them into the system prompt of a *new* session so the agent recalls the
#      user across conversations — even with an empty `messages[]` array.
#
# **NOTE:** Built-in strategies do NOT require an IAM execution role. AgentCore Memory
# manages the extraction/consolidation models for you. To customize those models or
# prompts, see the strategy-override examples under `02-long-term-memory`.

# You'll learn to:
# - Create a memory resource with built-in long-term strategies (no IAM role required)
# - Call Claude through Amazon Bedrock using the `AnthropicBedrock` client
# - Store each turn with `create_event` to feed the extraction pipeline
# - Wait for asynchronous extraction, then read records back with `retrieve_memories`
# - Inject retrieved long-term memories into the system prompt for a future session

#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# To execute this tutorial you will need:
# - Python 3.10+
# - AWS credentials with AgentCore Memory permissions AND Amazon Bedrock model access
# - Access to the Claude Sonnet 4.6 model in Amazon Bedrock (request it in the
#   Bedrock console under Model access, in your chosen region)
#
# Let's get started by setting up our environment!

# ## Step 1: Setup and Imports


# Run: pip install -qr requirements.txt


import logging
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime

# The Anthropic SDK's Amazon Bedrock client. `pip install "anthropic[bedrock]"`
# provides this; it signs requests with your AWS credentials (SigV4) and speaks the
# Messages API against Bedrock — no Anthropic API key required.
from anthropic import AnthropicBedrock

# AgentCore Memory client and the StrategyType enum (gives us the exact strategy keys).
from bedrock_agentcore.memory import MemoryClient
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.constants import StrategyType

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
logger = logging.getLogger("claude-sdk-ltm")

# Configuration
REGION = os.getenv("AWS_REGION", "us-west-2")  # AWS region for both Bedrock and Memory
ACTOR_ID = "user_123"  # Any unique identifier for the end-user / agent
SESSION_ID = "personal_session_001"  # Unique identifier for the first conversation

# Model ID for Claude Sonnet 4.6 on Amazon Bedrock.
# The `global.` prefix selects the global (cross-region) inference endpoint, which is
# the default for Sonnet 4.6 and carries no regional pricing premium. To pin traffic
# to a region instead, swap the prefix (e.g. "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6").
MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6"

# Namespace templates tell AgentCore where each strategy's records are written. The
# `{actorId}` placeholder is substituted with the actor at extraction time, keeping
# every user's records isolated. We retrieve from the resolved path (see Step 5).
# These follow the built-in defaults: facts per-user, preferences per-user.
SEMANTIC_NAMESPACE = "/users/{actorId}/facts/"
PREFERENCE_NAMESPACE = "/users/{actorId}/preferences/"

# Long-term extraction is asynchronous — records appear ~30-90s after create_event.
# We poll for them (Step 6) but cap the total wait so the demo always finishes.
EXTRACTION_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS = 120
EXTRACTION_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 15

SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are a helpful personal assistant. Be friendly, concise, and professional. "
    f"Today's date: {datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}."
)


# ## Step 2: Initialize the Claude (Bedrock) and Memory clients
#
# The `AnthropicBedrock` client resolves AWS credentials the same way boto3 does
# (environment variables, shared `~/.aws/credentials`, or an instance/role profile).
# We only need to tell it which region to call.


claude = AnthropicBedrock(aws_region=REGION)
memory_client = MemoryClient(region_name=REGION)
logger.info(f"✅ Clients initialized for region: {REGION}")


# ## Step 3: Create the Memory Resource (with built-in long-term strategies)
#
# This is the key difference from the short-term tutorial. There we passed
# `strategies=[]` (raw events only). Here we attach two built-in strategies:
#
# - **Semantic** — extracts standalone facts about the user/world (e.g. "User is
#   planning a trip to Japan"). Records land in the semantic namespace.
# - **User Preference** — extracts stable, durable preferences (e.g. "Prefers
#   vegetarian food"). Records land in the preferences namespace.
#
# Built-in strategies require NO IAM execution role — AgentCore manages the extraction
# and consolidation models. `create_or_get_memory` blocks until the resource is ACTIVE,
# and if a memory with this name already exists it returns the existing one instead of
# failing, so the demo is safe to re-run.


def get_or_create_memory(name: str) -> str:
    """Create a memory with built-in long-term strategies, or reuse it if it exists."""
    # Each strategy is a single-key dict: the key is the strategy type's wire value
    # (StrategyType.SEMANTIC.value == "semanticMemoryStrategy"), the value configures it.
    strategies = [
        {
            StrategyType.SEMANTIC.value: {
                "name": "PersonalAssistantFacts",
                "description": "Captures standalone facts about the user from conversations",
                "namespaces": [SEMANTIC_NAMESPACE],
            }
        },
        {
            StrategyType.USER_PREFERENCE.value: {
                "name": "PersonalAssistantPreferences",
                "description": "Captures stable user preferences across sessions",
                "namespaces": [PREFERENCE_NAMESPACE],
            }
        },
    ]

    # create_or_get_memory creates the resource if its name is free and otherwise
    # returns the existing memory dict, so we don't have to handle the name-clash case
    # ourselves. It blocks until the resource is ACTIVE.
    memory = memory_client.create_or_get_memory(
        name=name,
        strategies=strategies,  # Strategies => long-term extraction is enabled
        description="Long-term memory for the Claude SDK built-in-strategies tutorial",
        event_expiry_days=7,  # Retain raw events for 7 days (configurable 3-365)
        # NOTE: no memory_execution_role_arn — built-in strategies don't need one.
    )
    memory_id = memory["id"]
    logger.info(f"✅ Memory with built-in strategies ready: {memory_id}")
    return memory_id


# ## Step 4: The conversation turn
#
# Each turn mirrors the short-term tutorial: append the user message, call Claude with
# the full local history, append the reply, then persist the exchange with
# `create_event`. The ONLY difference is that, because this memory has strategies
# attached, every stored event is *also* fed into the long-term extraction pipeline.
# We don't call a special "extract" API — `create_event` is the trigger.


def extract_text(response) -> str:
    """Concatenate all text blocks from a Claude response.

    text blocks (this simple assistant defines no tools, so there are no tool_use

# ## Step 5: Retrieve long-term memories
#
# `retrieve_memories` runs a semantic search over a namespace and returns the most
# relevant records. The namespace must be FULLY RESOLVED — wildcards are not supported,
# so we substitute `{actorId}` ourselves. Each returned record is a dict whose
# `content.text` holds the extracted memory and `score` holds the relevance.
