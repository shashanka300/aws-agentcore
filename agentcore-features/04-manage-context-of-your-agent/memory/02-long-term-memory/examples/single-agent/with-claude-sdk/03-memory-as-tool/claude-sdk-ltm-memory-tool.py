# # Claude SDK with AgentCore Memory (Long-Term Memory — Memory as a Tool)
#
#
# ## Introduction
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to build a **conversational agent** using the
# **Anthropic Claude SDK** (via Amazon Bedrock) with AgentCore **long-term memory**
# exposed as **tools the model decides to call**. The two companion tutorials wired
# memory in *around* the model: `01-built-in-strategies` stored every turn and
# injected retrieved records into the system prompt; `02-custom-strategy-override`
# did the same with a customized extraction pipeline. In both, *your code* decided
# when to save and when to recall.
#
# Here we hand that decision to the agent. We define two tools —
# `store_memory` and `recall_memory` — and pass them to Claude via the `tools=`
# parameter. Claude chooses, on its own, when to persist a durable fact and when to
# search its past knowledge, by emitting `tool_use` blocks. We run the standard
# **agentic loop** (call the model → execute the tools it requested → feed the
# results back → repeat until it stops asking for tools), and the tool
# implementations call AgentCore Memory directly: `create_event` to store,
# `retrieve_memories` to recall.
#
# Because the Anthropic SDK is a **stateless API client** with NO built-in
# conversation management or hooks, the entire loop is explicit. That makes this the
# clearest possible view of the memory-as-tool pattern: there is no framework
# deciding anything for you — the model asks, your loop dispatches, AgentCore stores
# and retrieves.
#
# **NOTE:** We use a built-in **Semantic** strategy, so `store_memory`'s `create_event`
# call feeds the same asynchronous extraction pipeline used in tutorial 01, and
# `recall_memory`'s `retrieve_memories` reads the distilled records back. Built-in
# strategies require NO IAM execution role. Extraction is asynchronous (~30-90s), so a
# fact saved in one turn is not instantly searchable in the next — we therefore seed
# memory in a first session, wait for extraction, then show a *new* session where the
# agent recalls across the gap (exactly how it behaves in production).

# You'll learn to:
# - Define memory operations (`store_memory`, `recall_memory`) as Claude tools via `tools=`
# - Run the agentic loop (tool_use → tool_result → continue) per Anthropic's spec
# - Back those tools with AgentCore Memory: `create_event` to store, `retrieve_memories` to recall
# - Let the model decide WHEN to save a durable fact and WHEN to search its past knowledge
# - Show cross-session recall: a fresh session with empty `messages[]` where the agent
#   recovers context entirely by calling `recall_memory` itself
#
# ## Memory-as-tool vs. the other two patterns
#
# | | 01 — Built-in (post-response) | 02 — Custom override | 03 — Memory as a tool (this) |
# |---|---|---|---|
# | **Who decides to store** | Your code, after every turn | Your code, after every turn | **The model**, via `store_memory` |
# | **Who decides to recall** | Your code, at session start | Your code, at session start | **The model**, via `recall_memory` |
# | **How memory reaches the model** | Injected into the system prompt | Injected into the system prompt | Returned as a `tool_result` the model requested |
# | **Control flow** | Linear (store → retrieve → prompt) | Linear | **Agentic loop** (model drives) |
# | **Best when** | You want deterministic, always-on memory | …plus customized extraction | The model should manage its own memory lifecycle |

#
# ## Prerequisites
#
# To execute this tutorial you will need:
# - Python 3.10+
# - AWS credentials with AgentCore Memory permissions AND Amazon Bedrock model access
# - Access to the Claude Sonnet 4.6 model in Amazon Bedrock (request it in the
#   Bedrock console under Model access, in your chosen region)
#
# Let's get started by setting up our environment!

# ## Step 1: Setup and Imports


# Run: pip install -qr requirements.txt


import logging
import os
import time
from datetime import datetime

# The Anthropic SDK's Amazon Bedrock client. `pip install "anthropic[bedrock]"`
# provides this; it signs requests with your AWS credentials (SigV4) and speaks the
# Messages API against Bedrock — no Anthropic API key required.
from anthropic import AnthropicBedrock

# AgentCore Memory client and the StrategyType enum (gives us the exact strategy keys).
from bedrock_agentcore.memory import MemoryClient
from bedrock_agentcore.memory.constants import StrategyType

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
logger = logging.getLogger("claude-sdk-ltm-tool")

# Configuration
REGION = os.getenv("AWS_REGION", "us-west-2")  # AWS region for both Bedrock and Memory
ACTOR_ID = "user_789"  # Any unique identifier for the end-user / agent

# Two distinct sessions: the first seeds memory, the second (a "new conversation")
# recalls across the gap. Both share the same ACTOR_ID — that's what ties a user's
# long-term records together across sessions.
SEED_SESSION_ID = "assistant_session_001"
NEW_SESSION_ID = "assistant_session_002"

# Model ID for Claude Sonnet 4.6 on Amazon Bedrock.
# The `global.` prefix selects the global (cross-region) inference endpoint, which is
# the default for Sonnet 4.6 and carries no regional pricing premium. To pin traffic
# to a region instead, swap the prefix (e.g. "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6").
MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6"

# Namespace template for the semantic records. `{actorId}` is substituted at extraction
# time, keeping every user's facts isolated. `recall_memory` retrieves from the resolved
# path (see Step 3). This follows the built-in default: facts per-user.
SEMANTIC_NAMESPACE = "/users/{actorId}/facts/"

# Long-term extraction is asynchronous — records appear ~30-90s after create_event.
# We poll for them (Step 5) but cap the total wait so the demo always finishes.
EXTRACTION_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS = 120
EXTRACTION_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 15

# Safety bound on the agentic loop. A well-behaved model finishes in 1-3 iterations;
# the cap guarantees we never spin forever if it keeps requesting tools.
MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS = 6

# The system prompt is where we tell the agent it HAS memory tools and WHEN to use
# them. With the memory-as-tool pattern, this prompt is doing the steering that
# tutorials 01/02 did in code — be explicit so the model reaches for the tools.
SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are a helpful personal assistant with persistent long-term memory.\n"
    "\n"
    "You have two memory tools:\n"
    "- store_memory: save a durable fact about the user so you can recall it in future "
    "conversations. Call it whenever the user shares something worth remembering long-term "
    "— their name, preferences, goals, constraints, important dates. Do NOT store transient "
    "small talk or things that won't matter later.\n"
    "- recall_memory: search your long-term memory for facts you saved previously. Call it "
    "at the START of a conversation, and any time answering well depends on something the "
    "user may have told you before.\n"
    "\n"
    "Use these tools proactively and on your own judgment — the user will not remind you. "
    "Be friendly, concise, and professional. "
    f"Today's date: {datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}."
)


# ## Step 2: Initialize the Claude (Bedrock) and Memory clients
#
# The `AnthropicBedrock` client resolves AWS credentials the same way boto3 does
# (environment variables, shared `~/.aws/credentials`, or an instance/role profile).
# We only need to tell it which region to call.


claude = AnthropicBedrock(aws_region=REGION)
memory_client = MemoryClient(region_name=REGION)
logger.info(f"✅ Clients initialized for region: {REGION}")


# ## Step 3: Define the memory tools (schemas + implementations)
#
# A tool is two things: a JSON-Schema declaration the model sees (name, description,
# input shape) and a Python function that runs when the model calls it. The model only
# ever sees the declarations; it emits a `tool_use` block naming a tool and supplying
# arguments, and our loop (Step 4) routes that to the matching implementation.
#
# The descriptions are load-bearing — Claude decides WHETHER and WHEN to call a tool
# almost entirely from its description, so we state the trigger conditions explicitly.

TOOLS = [

        "name": "store_memory",
        "description": (
            "Save an important, durable fact about the user to long-term memory so it can "

            "information worth remembering across sessions — their name, preferences, goals, "
            "constraints, or notable personal details. Do NOT call it for transient small "

#   • (wait for extraction)
#   • Session 2 (new): a FRESH `messages[]` array — no short-term history at all. The
#     user asks something that depends on the past. The agent should call `recall_memory`
#     itself to recover the context, then answer.
#
# We never inject memory into the prompt and never call create_event/retrieve_memories
# directly in the demo flow — every memory operation happens because the MODEL asked.
