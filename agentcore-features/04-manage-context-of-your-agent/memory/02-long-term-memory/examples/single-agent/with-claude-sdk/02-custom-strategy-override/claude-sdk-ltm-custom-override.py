# # Claude SDK with AgentCore Memory (Long-Term Memory — Custom Strategy Override)
#
#
# ## Introduction
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to build a **conversational agent** using the
# **Anthropic Claude SDK** (via Amazon Bedrock) with AgentCore **long-term memory**
# powered by a **built-in strategy with overrides** (also called a *custom strategy
# override*). The companion tutorial `01-built-in-strategies` used the default
# AgentCore-managed extraction pipeline. Here we keep that same pipeline and fixed
# output schema, but override two things:
#
#   - the **model** used for each step (extraction / consolidation), and
#   - the **prompt instructions** appended to that step's system prompt.
#
# This is the middle rung of customization. Built-in strategies (tutorial 01) give you
# zero-config extraction with AgentCore-managed models. Self-managed strategies (the far
# end — see `02-long-term-memory/03-self-managed-strategy`) hand you the entire pipeline
# via S3 + SNS + your own Lambda. Overrides sit in between: you keep AgentCore's managed
# extraction loop and its fixed record schema, but you steer *what* it extracts and
# *which* model does the work.
#
# Because the Anthropic SDK is a **stateless API client** with NO built-in conversation
# management or hooks, the integration is fully explicit. We:
#   1. create an IAM execution role (REQUIRED for overrides — Bedrock bills your account),
#   2. create a memory resource with a CUSTOM strategy wrapping a `semanticOverride`,
#      supplying our own extraction/consolidation models and prompt addenda,
#   3. drive a conversation, persisting each turn with `create_event` (the same call used
#      for built-in strategies — the override only changes how extraction runs),
#   4. wait for the asynchronous extraction to run with OUR model + prompt,
#   5. retrieve the custom-extracted records with `retrieve_memories`, and
#   6. inject them into the system prompt of a *new* session so the agent recalls the
#      user across conversations.
#
# **NOTE:** Built-in *with overrides* strategies REQUIRE an IAM execution role
# (`memory_execution_role_arn`). AgentCore assumes that role to invoke the Bedrock model
# you specified, and the invocations bill against YOUR account and quotas. This is the
# key operational difference from the plain built-in strategies in tutorial 01.

# You'll learn to:
# - Create the IAM execution role that override strategies require
# - Create a memory resource with a `customMemoryStrategy` wrapping a `semanticOverride`
# - Supply your own `modelId` and `appendToPrompt` for extraction AND consolidation
# - Call Claude through Amazon Bedrock using the `AnthropicBedrock` client
# - Store each turn with `create_event` — extraction now runs with YOUR model + prompt
# - Retrieve the domain-scoped records with `retrieve_memories` and inject them downstream
#
# ## When to use overrides vs. built-in strategies
#
# Reach for a custom strategy override when the *default* extraction doesn't fit, but you
# still want AgentCore to run the pipeline for you:
#
# - **Domain-specific extraction.** You only care about a narrow slice of the conversation
#   (clinical facts, financial events, legal entities) and want everything else ignored.
#   This tutorial's healthcare intake agent is exactly this case — extract medications,
#   allergies, and conditions; ignore chit-chat.
# - **Compliance / model pinning.** Regulation or policy requires a specific, audited model
#   version for any LLM that touches user data, or you must keep all inference in-region.
# - **Different language or tone.** The user base speaks a language (or jargon) the default
#   prompt doesn't handle well, and you want extraction instructions in that language.
# - **Custom consolidation rules.** You need explicit rules for how new records merge with
#   old ones (e.g. "a severe allergy supersedes a mild one"; "prefer the most recent dose").
# - **Cost / latency tuning.** Swap in Haiku for high-volume, low-margin extraction or
#   Sonnet for nuanced consolidation — independently per step.
#
# Stick with **plain built-in strategies** (tutorial 01) when the defaults are fine: it's
# simpler and needs no IAM role. Graduate to a **self-managed strategy** only when you need
# a record schema the built-ins can't produce, a non-Bedrock model, or external lookups
# before deciding what to store — overrides cannot change the record shape, only the
# instructions and the model.

# ## Prerequisites
#
# To execute this tutorial you will need:
# - Python 3.10+
# - AWS credentials with AgentCore Memory permissions, Amazon Bedrock model access, AND
#   IAM permissions to create a role (iam:CreateRole, iam:PutRolePolicy, iam:GetRole) —
#   or pass an existing role ARN via the MEMORY_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN environment variable.
# - Access to the Claude Sonnet 4.6 model in Amazon Bedrock (request it in the Bedrock
#   console under Model access, in your chosen region). The override model you pick must
#   also be accessible to the execution role.
#
# Let's get started by setting up our environment!

# Configuration
REGION = os.getenv("AWS_REGION", "us-west-2")  # AWS region for Bedrock, Memory, and IAM
ACTOR_ID = "patient_456"  # Any unique identifier for the end-user / agent
SESSION_ID = "intake_session_001"  # Unique identifier for the first conversation

# Model ID for Claude Sonnet 4.6 on Amazon Bedrock.
# The `global.` prefix selects the global (cross-region) inference endpoint, which is
# the default for Sonnet 4.6 and carries no regional pricing premium. To pin traffic
# to a region instead, swap the prefix (e.g. "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6").
MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6"

# The model AgentCore should use for the OVERRIDDEN extraction and consolidation steps.
# This is the heart of the override: instead of AgentCore's managed default, the
# extraction pipeline invokes THIS model (in your account, via the execution role).
# We use the same Sonnet 4.6 endpoint here, but you can pick any Bedrock model the
# execution role can invoke — e.g. Haiku for cheaper high-volume extraction.
OVERRIDE_MODEL_ID = os.getenv("OVERRIDE_MODEL_ID", "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6")

# Namespace template for the custom semantic records. `{actorId}` is substituted at
# extraction time, keeping every patient's clinical facts isolated. We retrieve from
# the resolved path (see Step 6).
CLINICAL_NAMESPACE = "/patients/{actorId}/clinical-facts/"

# Custom prompt addenda. `appendToPrompt` is ADDED to AgentCore's built-in system prompt
# for each step — it should NARROW or CLARIFY the default behavior, not contradict it.
# The output record schema is fixed; only these instructions and the model change.

    "same substance; an updated dosage supersedes an older dosage for the same medication."

# ## Step 3: Create the IAM Execution Role (REQUIRED for overrides)
#
# Unlike plain built-in strategies, an override strategy makes AgentCore invoke a Bedrock
# model *in your account*. To allow that, you create an IAM role AgentCore can assume and
# pass its ARN as `memory_execution_role_arn` when creating the memory. The role needs:
#
# - a **trust policy** letting `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com` assume it (scoped to your
#   account + region), and
# - a **permissions policy** allowing `bedrock:InvokeModel` /
#   `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` on the override model.
#
# These policies mirror the AWS documentation for built-in-with-overrides strategies. If
# you already have a suitable role, set MEMORY_EXECUTION_ROLE_ARN and we'll use it as-is.

# This is the key difference from tutorial 01. There we attached a plain

#
# - `appendToPrompt` — instructions added to that step's built-in system prompt, and
# - `modelId` — the Bedrock model AgentCore invokes for that step (billed to your account).
#
# The override keeps the built-in semantic record SCHEMA — only the instructions and the
# model change. `create_or_get_memory` blocks until the resource is ACTIVE, reuses an
# existing memory of the same name, and (unlike tutorial 01) we MUST pass
# `memory_execution_role_arn`.
