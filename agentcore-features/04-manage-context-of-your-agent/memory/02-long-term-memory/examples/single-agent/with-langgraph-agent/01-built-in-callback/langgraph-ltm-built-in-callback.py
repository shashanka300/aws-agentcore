# # LangGraph with AgentCore Memory — Built-in Callback (Long-term Memory)
#
# ## Introduction
#
# This tutorial demonstrates the **lowest-effort** way to give a LangGraph agent
# long-term memory: let the `langgraph-checkpoint-aws` package wire AgentCore Memory
# into the agent's lifecycle for you. Two AgentCore integrations do the work, and your
# code never calls `create_event` / `retrieve_memories` directly:
#
# 1. **`AgentCoreMemorySaver`** — a LangGraph **checkpointer** backed by AgentCore
#    Memory. Once you pass it to the agent, conversation **state is persisted and
#    resumed automatically** at every super-step, keyed by `thread_id` (session) and
#    `actor_id`. No save/load code at all.
# 2. **`AgentCoreMemoryStore`** — a LangGraph **store** backed by AgentCore Memory's
#    long-term strategies. We attach two tiny **middleware callbacks** (`@after_model`
#    to persist each turn, `@dynamic_prompt` to inject recalled facts). The store turns
#    `store.put(...)` into a `create_event` and `store.search(...)` into a
#    `retrieve_memories` under the hood, and the AgentCore **Semantic strategy** does the
#    extraction asynchronously in the background.
#
# This is the "framework handles the lifecycle" pattern: you declare *where* memory
# hooks into the graph and the integration does the rest. Compare with
# [`02-custom-callback/`](../02-custom-callback/), where the callbacks hand-roll the
# retrieval, context injection, and storage logic themselves.
#
# > **LangGraph API note (v1.0):** `langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent` and its
# > `pre_model_hook` / `post_model_hook` arguments are **deprecated** in LangGraph v1.0.
# > The current API is `from langchain.agents import create_agent` with the
# > **middleware** system (`@before_model`, `@after_model`, `@dynamic_prompt`,
# > `@wrap_model_call`) from `langchain.agents.middleware`. This tutorial uses the
# > current API. Middleware callbacks receive `(state, runtime)` — not `config` — so we
# > carry the per-user identity (`actor_id`, `session_id`) in a typed **runtime context**
# > (`context_schema`), and the checkpointer reads `thread_id` / `actor_id` from the
# > runtime `config` as it always has.

# You'll learn to:
# - Use `AgentCoreMemorySaver` as a **checkpointer** so conversation state persists automatically
# - Use `AgentCoreMemoryStore` as the long-term backend with **minimal** callback wiring
# - Write v1.0 **middleware** (`@after_model`, `@dynamic_prompt`) instead of deprecated pre/post hooks
# - Pass per-user identity through a typed **runtime context** (`context_schema`)
# - Let the AgentCore Semantic strategy extract durable facts in the background
#
# ### Scenario Context
#
# We build a **Nutrition Assistant** that remembers user context (dietary restrictions,
# goals, preferences) across sessions. The user shares facts in session 1; after the
# Semantic strategy extracts them, a brand-new session 2 recalls them automatically —
# the `@dynamic_prompt` callback injects the recalled facts before the model runs.

# ## Prerequisites
#
# - Python 3.10+
# - AWS account with appropriate permissions
# - AWS credentials with AgentCore Memory permissions AND Amazon Bedrock model access
# - Access to the Claude Haiku 4.5 model in Amazon Bedrock (request it in the Bedrock
#   console under *Model access*, in your chosen region)
# - No IAM execution role required — we use a **built-in** Semantic strategy, for which
#   AgentCore manages the extraction/consolidation models.
#
# Let's get started by setting up our environment!

# ## Step 1: Setup and Imports


# Run: pip install -qr requirements.txt

# (gives us the exact wire key for the Semantic strategy).

from bedrock_agentcore.memory.constants import StrategyType

# LangGraph v1.0 agent factory + middleware. NOTE: this replaces the deprecated
# `from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent` and its pre/post model hooks.
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import after_model, dynamic_prompt
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

# The AgentCore Memory integrations for LangGraph (the `langgraph-checkpoint-aws`

from langgraph_checkpoint_aws import AgentCoreMemorySaver, AgentCoreMemoryStore

# Setup logging

logger = logging.getLogger("langgraph-ltm-built-in")

# Configuration
REGION = os.getenv("AWS_REGION", "us-west-2")  # AWS region for both Bedrock and Memory

# Model ID for Claude Haiku 4.5 on Amazon Bedrock. The `global.` prefix selects the
# global (cross-region) inference endpoint. To pin traffic to a region instead, swap the
# prefix (e.g. "us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0").
MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0"

# One end-user. Two sessions: the first seeds memory, the second (a "new conversation")
# recalls across the gap. Both share the same ACTOR_ID — that's what ties a user's
# long-term records together across sessions.
ACTOR_ID = "user-1"
SEED_SESSION_ID = "nutrition-session-1"
NEW_SESSION_ID = "nutrition-session-2"

# Namespace template for the extracted Semantic records. `{actorId}` is substituted at
# extraction time, keeping every user's facts isolated. The `@dynamic_prompt` callback
# reads from the resolved prefix (see Step 4). Always end the template with "/".
SEMANTIC_NAMESPACE = "/users/{actorId}/facts/"

# Long-term extraction is asynchronous — records appear ~30-90s after a turn is saved.
# We poll for them (Step 6) but cap the wait so the demo always finishes.
EXTRACTION_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS = 120
EXTRACTION_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 15


# ## Step 2: The runtime context (how identity reaches the callbacks)
#
# In LangGraph v1.0, middleware callbacks receive `(state, runtime)` — they do NOT get
# the invocation `config`. Per-run, per-user values therefore travel in a typed
# **runtime context** object that we declare here and pass to `create_agent` via
# `context_schema=`. We supply an instance at invoke time with `context=...`, and the
# callbacks read `runtime.context.actor_id` / `runtime.context.session_id`.


@dataclass
class MemoryContext:
    """Per-invocation identity made available to middleware as `runtime.context`."""

    actor_id: str
    session_id: str


# ## Step 3: Initialize the clients, the store, and the checkpointer
#
# `AgentCoreMemoryStore` takes `memory_id` as a keyword argument; `AgentCoreMemorySaver`
# takes it positionally (both forward extra kwargs such as `region_name` to boto3). They
# are created once and reused across sessions — what changes per session is the runtime
# context and config, not the integrations.


memory_client = MemoryClient(region_name=REGION)


# ## Step 4: The memory middleware (the "built-in callback")
#
# Two small callbacks are the entire long-term-memory wiring. The integration does the
# heavy lifting: `store.put` becomes a `create_event`, `store.search` becomes a
# `retrieve_memories`, and the Semantic strategy extracts durable facts in the
# background. We never touch the AgentCore API directly here.
