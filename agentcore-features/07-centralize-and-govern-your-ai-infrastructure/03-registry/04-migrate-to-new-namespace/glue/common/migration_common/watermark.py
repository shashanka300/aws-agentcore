"""Incremental-load watermarks: remember what was already migrated, per mapping.

An ``INCREMENTAL`` run needs a cutoff. Rather than making an operator supply a timestamp every
time, the engine remembers one per registry mapping and uses it automatically.

The watermark records the **last successful load**, not the last extract. That distinction
matters: if extraction succeeds but the load fails, advancing the watermark would permanently skip
those records. So extraction only proposes a *candidate* (written into the extract manifest), and
transform/load commits it once the records for that mapping are actually in the target registry.

Cutoff selection, in order:

1. An explicit ``changedAfter`` in the run configuration always wins -- it is auditable and lets
   an operator re-migrate a window deliberately.
2. Otherwise the committed watermark's ``maxUpdatedAt``, minus an overlap buffer.
3. If neither exists, the mapping errors instead of silently degrading to a full load.

The overlap buffer re-migrates a few minutes either side of the boundary to absorb clock skew and
records updated *during* the previous run. Re-processing is harmless because the load is an
idempotent upsert.

This module also holds the **id map**, the other thing a run has to remember for the next one:
which target record each source record became. Both are committed state under ``state/``, keyed per
mapping, read at the start of a run and written at the end, so they live together rather than in
two near-identical modules. Their names are prefixed (``read_idmap`` beside ``read``) because their
commit rules are deliberately *not* the same -- see ``read_idmap`` below.

    them on the next run: without it, a second run has only two ways to recognise a record it
    already migrated -- the name, and, for URL-synchronized records, the descriptor source. A record
    renamed in Preview between two runs defeats both, so it would be migrated a second time as a new
    target record, leaving the one it was migrated to the first time behind as an orphan. The source
    recordId is the only identifier that survives a rename, so it is the one worth persisting.

    Unlike the watermark, this is committed even when part of a run failed, and even for a record
    that was created and then failed to settle. Both follow from what the map is for: the entries
    name records that already exist in the target registry, and forgetting one does not make the next
    run re-read it safely -- it makes the next run create a second copy of it. Dry runs write no map,
    having created nothing to remember.

    A missing map is normal -- it is the first run for this mapping -- and reads as empty rather than
    an error. A *malformed* one is an error: silently treating it as empty would migrate every
