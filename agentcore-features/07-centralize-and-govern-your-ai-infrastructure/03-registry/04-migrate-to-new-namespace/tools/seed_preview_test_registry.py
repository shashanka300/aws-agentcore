"""Create a Preview Agent Registry and seed it with a migration test matrix.

Produces a small registry that exercises every descriptor variant and the awkward shapes the
transform has to handle -- nested supplementary descriptors, per-descriptor sync sources,
credential providers, versions, unicode, and large payloads -- so a migration run can be validated
end to end without touching a production registry. On top of that base matrix it also covers:

  * dedup-key gaps -- the target key is (name, recordVersion), and Preview enforces neither part,
  * lifecycle states beyond the DRAFT/PENDING_APPROVAL/APPROVED/REJECTED set (DEPRECATED),
  * boundary values at the limits the service actually enforces,
  * records whose own history matters (edited after approval, so updatedAt > createdAt).

EVERY fixture here is a shape the live service is known to accept. The aim is a registry the
migration can be run against, so a record that cannot be created contributes nothing: it tests
registry validation rather than the migration, and shows up as noise in the run output. A rejection
is therefore a genuine failure -- the run reports it and exits 2.

An earlier revision carried 11 deliberately-invalid fixtures to probe the gap between the C2J model
and the service. They have been removed, but their conclusions are worth keeping, because each one
retires a migration risk that code reading alone leaves open:

  * The service enforces a much stricter contract than the model publishes. Ten model-legal shapes
    were all rejected: "At least one of descriptors or synchronizationConfiguration must be
    provided", "MCP descriptor type requires mcp descriptor", "mcp.server is required",
    "mcp.server must specify inlineContent", "MCP descriptor type can't have other descriptors",
    "CUSTOM descriptor type requires custom descriptor", "synchronizationConfiguration is not
    supported for the specified descriptor type". So a descriptor-less record, an empty descriptor,
    a tools-only MCP record, two descriptor variants at once, and a descriptorType contradicting
    its body are all impossible in a customer registry. In particular the transform-vs-validate
    stage disagreement (transform accepts a content-free descriptor, validate_target_request then
    rejects it) is unreachable, and descriptorType can never disagree with the inferred recordType.
  * The one descriptor-less form that IS accepted is a sync config with no descriptors (fixture A8,
    since removed -- see ONE_SYNC_FIXTURE_ONLY). It does not yield a content-free record: the service
    fetches the URL and materializes the content inline, so the migration only ever sees a
    materialized record or a CREATE_FAILED one.
  * Descriptor content is capped at 100KB in TOTAL across descriptors, not per ``inlineContent`` as
    the model's 102400 bound implies. A single descriptor at exactly 102400 is rejected, so a record
    with two max-size descriptors cannot exist. See TOTAL_CONTENT_MAX.
  * ``RegistryRecordSummary`` declares ``recordVersion`` required, but the service OMITS it for a
    record created without one, so ``_find_existing`` compares None to None and matches. The
    duplicate-creation risk that the required-ness implied does not materialize (fixture B5 stays
    in as a regression guard, since it is a valid record either way).

Live findings that are migration problems rather than retired risks. Both were reproduced against
a real registry, and both are service behaviour rather than tool defects, so neither is seeded any
more -- the fixtures that produced them were removed and the conclusions kept here instead:

  * A successful URL sync OVERWRITES the record's name and recordVersion with the values from the
    fetched document. All eight fixtures pointing at one MCP endpoint were renamed to the same
    (name, recordVersion) -- "contextstudios-mcp" / "1.2.1" -- which is exactly the target dedup key.
    The same overwrite happens again on the target side when the migration recreates the record, so a
    registry holding two records synced from one upstream cannot be migrated at all: renaming them
    in Preview only moves the collision from the extract stage's duplicate-name guard to the load
    stage. This is the headline migration risk in this matrix, and it cost the tool a real defect --
    the loader used to perform the collapse silently, merging four source records into one target record
    and reporting three of them as successes. It now refuses instead (``_claim_target_record``).
    Only one fixture is seeded on the shared URL; see ONE_SYNC_FIXTURE_ONLY.
  * the target dedup key is (name, recordVersion) and Preview enforced neither part, so a Preview
    registry may legitimately hold two records with one name and no version. The tool handles this
    correctly -- extract detects the clash, names the offending records, and resolves it once
    ``runtime.transform.duplicateNames`` is set to ``suffix`` -- so a duplicate pair is no longer
    seeded. It only forced every run of this matrix to carry that setting.

Usage:
  python3 tools/seed_preview_test_registry.py --dry-run           # print the matrix only
  python3 tools/seed_preview_test_registry.py --profile <profile>  # create + seed
  python3 tools/seed_preview_test_registry.py --registry-id <id>  # seed an existing registry
  python3 tools/seed_preview_test_registry.py --region us-east-1 --name my-test-registry

Requires AWS credentials with bedrock-agentcore registry create permissions. Records are created
with the Preview API shapes (descriptorType + descriptors.<variant> + inlineContent).

# --- payload fixtures -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Content rules enforced by the Preview API (discovered empirically -- a fixture that violates
# any of these is rejected with a ValidationException, so the base matrix stays inside them):
#   * mcp.server        schemaVersion must be MCP_SCHEMA_VERSION; content is server.json
#   * mcp.tools         protocolVersion must be MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION; content is {"tools": [...]}
#   * a2a.agentCard     schemaVersion must be A2A_SCHEMA_VERSION; content is an A2A agent card
#   * skillDefinition   schemaVersion must be SKILL_SCHEMA_VERSION; content is JSON
#   * skillMd           content MUST begin with '---' YAML frontmatter
#   * custom            content MUST be a structured JSON object or array (not a bare string)
#   * synchronizationConfiguration is accepted only for MCP and A2A records, never for
#     AGENT_SKILLS or CUSTOM ("synchronizationConfiguration is not supported for the specified
#     descriptor type")
#
# Sync configuration is also resolved at creation time, asynchronously: the registry fetches the
# URL and exercises any credential provider, and the record settles in CREATE_FAILED if that
# fails. So a sync fixture needs a genuinely reachable URL, and credential-provider fixtures need
# a real OAuth2 credential provider / assumable IAM role (hence --with-credential-providers,
# which is off by default). A successful URL sync also *overwrites* the record's name and
# recordVersion with the values from the fetched document.
DEFAULT_MCP_SYNC_URL = "https://mcp.contextstudios.ai/api/public/mcp"

# ONE_SYNC_FIXTURE_ONLY -- why this matrix contains exactly one MCP sync fixture.
#
# A successful URL sync overwrites the record's name AND recordVersion with the values from the
# fetched document. That happens on BOTH sides: in the Preview registry when the fixture is seeded,
# and again in the target registry when the migration recreates it. So N records synced from one URL
# collapse into one (name, recordVersion) -- which is exactly the target dedup key -- no matter what
# names they were given. Renaming them after creation gets the Preview side past the extract stage's
# duplicate-name guard, but the service renames them again on create, so the collision simply moves to the
# load stage. There is no way to seed two records from one upstream and have both survive.
#
# This matrix therefore keeps ONE fixture on the shared URL (mcp-sync-url-reachable), which covers
# the migration path that matters: a top-level sync config becoming source.fromUrl on the
# descriptor. Five fixtures that also needed it -- A8, D2b, E1, E2, E4 -- were removed. Their
# findings are all CONFIRMED and recorded in the module docstring; testing them again needs one
# further distinct, genuinely reachable MCP endpoint per fixture, not a second name for this one.
