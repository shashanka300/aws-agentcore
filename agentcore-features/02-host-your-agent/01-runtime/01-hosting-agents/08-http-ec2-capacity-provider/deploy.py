"""
Deploy one Strands agent TWICE onto ONE CapacityProvider — as a zip, and as a
container — to show that the artifact type and the compute type are orthogonal.

What this script does:

  1. IAM      — execution role for the runtimes, if absent
  2. S3       — bucket for the zip artifact
  3. Zip      — vendor arm64 deps, zip, upload
  4. ECR      — repository + image, built on Graviton via CodeBuild
  5. CP       — ONE CapacityProvider: real EC2 instances in your VPC
  6. Runtimes — TWO agent runtimes on that CP, one per artifact type
  7. Config   — write cp_config.json for invoke.py / cleanup.py

PLAIN BOTO3, ONE CLIENT
-----------------------
There is no `scripts/` helper any more, and no service-model file to install.
`boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore-control")` carries everything this sample
needs:

    create_capacity_provider    get_capacity_provider    update_capacity_provider
    list_capacity_providers     delete_capacity_provider
    list_agent_runtime_versions_by_capacity_provider

and `create_agent_runtime` accepts `capacityProviderConfiguration`. The
CapacityProvider APIs and the agent-runtime APIs are the SAME service
(`bedrock-agentcore-control`, API version 2023-06-05), so one client does both —
see `require_capacity_provider_support` for the version floor.

Usage:
    python deploy.py                 # both artifacts (default)
    python deploy.py --only zip      # zip only — fastest, no Docker/CodeBuild
    python deploy.py --only container

    Make the CapacityProvider's EC2 instances visible in the console and in

    Since EC2 Managed Resource Visibility shipped (April 2026), instances that an
    AWS service provisions on your behalf are **hidden by default** from console
    views and from `DescribeInstances`. A CapacityProvider's instances are exactly
    that: AgentCore launches them, so EC2 classes them as managed.

    The default is a good one in general — it keeps EKS, ECS and Lambda fleets out
    of your instance list. It is the wrong default *here*, for one specific
    reason: **hidden instances are still running and still billing.** This sample
    launches real instances in your account, and the thing you most need to be
    able to check is whether any survived cleanup. A confirmation step you cannot
    see is worse than no confirmation step.

    So this turns visibility on and, deliberately, never turns it back off —
    cleanup.py leaves it alone. Reverting it at the end of a run would re-hide
    the instances at exactly the moment you want to look for leftovers.

    TWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU RUN THIS
    --------------------------------------
    1. The setting is **account-wide** and applies to every IAM principal in the
       account, not just you and not just this sample. Turning it on also
       un-hides any EKS, ECS, Lambda and WorkSpaces managed instances you have.
    2. It is not required. The alternative is to leave the account hidden and
       pass `--include-managed-resources` on every `describe-instances` call.
       Set CP_MANAGED_VISIBILITY=skip to take that route, and see the README.

    Visibility changes nothing operationally: hidden or visible, the instances
    run and bill identically.

    allowed, which VPC/subnet they join, and when idle instances shut down.
    Instances are launched into YOUR account, on demand, when a session
    starts. There are none running right after this call returns.

    Required members are exactly three: `name`, `permissionsConfiguration` and
    `computeConfiguration`. `description`, `tags` and `clientToken` are optional.

    Terminal state is READY — not ACTIVE. The full status enum is CREATING,
    CREATE_FAILED, UPDATING, UPDATE_FAILED, READY, DELETING, DELETE_FAILED. There
    is no waiter for CapacityProviders (`client.waiter_names` lists only Memory
    and Policy waiters), so this polls.

    NOTE: a CapacityProvider is immutable except for its description —
    `update_capacity_provider` takes `description` and nothing else. Changing the
    machine shape means creating a new one, by design, so a running fleet's shape
    cannot shift under you.
