"""
Deploy an A2A agent onto a CapacityProvider.

  1. IAM      — execution role for the runtime (with bedrock:InvokeModel), and
                the CP operator role
  2. S3       — bucket for the zip artifact
  3. Zip      — vendor arm64 deps, zip, upload
  4. CP       — the EC2 fleet
  5. Runtime  — serverProtocol=A2A (the one line that differs from Sample 1)
  6. Config   — write cp_config.json for invoke.py / cleanup.py

THE ONE LINE THAT MAKES IT A2A
------------------------------
    protocolConfiguration={"serverProtocol": "A2A"}

The `serverProtocol` enum accepts MCP, HTTP, A2A and AGUI (verified by reading
the ServerProtocol shape in the installed bedrock-agentcore-control model).
That single field changes the contract the runtime expects from your artifact:

    HTTP  →  port 8080, POST /invocations, GET /ping
    MCP   →  port 8000, POST /mcp  (JSON-RPC, streamable-HTTP)
    A2A   →  port 9000, POST /     (JSON-RPC 2.0, + agent card)

The ports are fixed by the AgentCore Runtime service contract, not by
preference. Get the port wrong and the runtime cannot reach your server at all.

PLAIN BOTO3, ONE CLIENT
-----------------------
There is no `scripts/` helper any more, and no service-model file to install.
`boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore-control")` carries both the CapacityProvider
APIs and the agent-runtime APIs — they are the same service (API version
2023-06-05). See `require_capacity_provider_support` for the version floor, and
Sample 1's README → "Same client".

ZIP ONLY
--------
This sample deploys a zip artifact and nothing else — no ECR, no CodeBuild, no
Dockerfile. Sample 1 shows the container path side by side with the zip one if
you want to compare them.

Usage:
    python deploy.py

    Make the CapacityProvider's EC2 instances visible in the console and in

    Since EC2 Managed Resource Visibility shipped (April 2026), instances that an
    AWS service provisions on your behalf are **hidden by default** from console
    views and from `DescribeInstances`. A CapacityProvider's instances are exactly
    that: AgentCore launches them, so EC2 classes them as managed.

    The default is a good one in general — it keeps EKS, ECS and Lambda fleets out
    of your instance list. It is the wrong default *here*, for one specific
    reason: **hidden instances are still running and still billing.** This sample
    launches real instances in your account, and the thing you most need to be
    able to check is whether any survived cleanup. A confirmation step you cannot
    see is worse than no confirmation step.

    So this turns visibility on and, deliberately, never turns it back off —
    cleanup.py leaves it alone. Reverting it at the end of a run would re-hide
    the instances at exactly the moment you want to look for leftovers.

    TWO THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU RUN THIS

       account, not just you and not just this sample. Turning it on also
       un-hides any EKS, ECS, Lambda and WorkSpaces managed instances you have.
    2. It is not required. The alternative is to leave the account hidden and
       pass `--include-managed-resources` on every `describe-instances` call.
       Set CP_MANAGED_VISIBILITY=skip to take that route, and see the README.

    Create the CapacityProvider — the one API with no serverless equivalent.

    This declares the fleet your agent will run on: which instance types are
    allowed, which VPC/subnet they join, and when idle instances shut down.
    Instances are launched into YOUR account, on demand, when a session starts.
    There are none running right after this call returns.

    On the A2A path the VPC choice matters more than usual: because the instances
    sit in a VPC you own, a peer agent in the same VPC can reach port 9000
    directly and fetch the agent card the normal A2A way — which
    `InvokeAgentRuntime` cannot do. See the README → "The agent card is not
    reachable through InvokeAgentRuntime".

    Required members are exactly three: `name`, `permissionsConfiguration` and
    `computeConfiguration`. `description`, `tags` and `clientToken` are optional.

    Terminal state is READY — not ACTIVE. The full status enum is CREATING,
    CREATE_FAILED, UPDATING, UPDATE_FAILED, READY, DELETING, DELETE_FAILED. There
    is no waiter for CapacityProviders, so this polls.

    NOTE: a CapacityProvider is immutable except for its description —
    `update_capacity_provider` takes `description` and nothing else. Changing the
    machine shape means creating a new one, by design, so a running fleet's shape
